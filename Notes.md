#Notes

1. Courtesy posts

  a. Rescue Groups posts person’s actual email address.
  
  b. Change this to a form that a user can submit that will then email the person from the server. 
  
  c. This will not only protect the person’s email address but allow logging and tracking the emails.

2. Allow visitors to email FFLAH to ask questions about an animal without creating an account.

3. Use templates for adding animals.

4. Allow linking to existing animals in bio editor.

5. Send weekly (monthly?) email listing animals on site.

6. Make sure the node_modules folder is hidden to keep Visual Studio from trying to scan the folder on build and choking on max path length.
